I have no words to explain how happy I am to have spoken to you with over a hundred students about machine learning.

Here is all the practical material that we saw that night, I will spend a little step by step so you can install and learn a lot with these few lines of code.

You need to install these libs:

pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib
pip install tabulate
pip install flask

In order to execute this codes:

Step 1 - Run preprocessing.py to generate a new dataset with preprocessing on it.
Step 2 - Run model.py to generate a dump with model.
Step 3 - Run api.py and go to browser and set localhost:5500
Step 4 - You can test the exported dump model runing test-static-model.py changing the array

Bonus

Run 
Run model-kmeans.py to see how clusters are so powerfull
